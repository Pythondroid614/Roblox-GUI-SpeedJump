# Roblox GUI Speed & JumpPower

A simple Roblox Lua script that creates a GUI with buttons to change the player's **WalkSpeed** and **JumpPower**.  

## Features
- GUI with two buttons:  
  - **Set WalkSpeed (50)** – changes the player's speed to 50  
  - **Set JumpPower (100)** – changes the player's jump power to 100  

## How to use
1. Open **Roblox Studio**.  
2. Create a new place or open your game.  
3. Insert a **LocalScript** into **StarterGui**.  
4. Copy the contents of `GuiScript.lua` into the LocalScript.  
5. Run the game and test the GUI.  

## Preview
When you run the game, a simple gray frame will appear with two buttons:  
- "Set WalkSpeed (50)"  
- "Set JumpPower (100)"  

Clicking the buttons will instantly change your character’s movement stats.
